# Project about design patterns

## Based on gang of four:

### Creational patterns:

- Abstract Factory.
  - This design pattern is useful when there are family or dependant objects. The key element is the main inferface for the factories that can be used in the code 
  - The system should be easily extensible 
  - With this pattern you can have loosely coupled classes
  - And if you want to change this during execution 
  - TODO Multi platform database connections.
- Chain of constructor.
- Factory.
- Other factory.
- Singleton.
